Make sure docker and git is installed

1. Clone the project

`git clone https://github.com/bluewave-labs/guidefox.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory

`cd guidefox`

3. Run docker

`docker compose build`

`docker compose up`

## Server Installation

1. Make sure Docker is installed to your machine where the server will run.
2. Make sure git is installed to your machine Git.
3. Make sure nginx is installed.

4. Clone GitHub Repository

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bluewave-labs/guidefox.git
cd bluewave-onboarding
```

5. Configure Nginx

Open the Nginx configuration file:

`sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/guidefox`


Add the following configuration. Change YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME with your domain name:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4173; # Frontend React app
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Backend API
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
    location /mailhog/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8025; # MailHog web interface
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

6. Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:

`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/guidefox /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`

7. Install Certbot and its Nginx plugin:

`sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`

Make sure you have `/etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf` If not you can get it from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf

8. Obtain SSL Certificate. Run Certbot to obtain a certificate for your domain:

`sudo certbot --nginx`

9. Verify the Nginx configuration:

`sudo nginx -t`

10. Restart Nginx to apply the changes:

`sudo systemctl restart nginx`

11. Start the project

`cd ~/guidefox
docker compose up -d`

## Environment variables

In order to the project to run safely and correctly, the user should add their own environment variables. They can be added to the .env file in the backend directory of the project. The following is the list of environment variables that should be added and its description:

1. Node Env

```env
NODE_ENV - node environment (production, test or development)
```

It is set from the .env file in the root directory

2. Api Url

```
API_BASE_URL - Backend API url
```

It is set from ./frontend/src/utils/constant.js

3. Database credentials

In the root folder

```env
POSTGRES_USER - Database username (The same as DB_USERNAME)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD -Database password (The same as DB_PASSWORD)
POSTGRES_DB - Database name (The same as DB_NAME)
```

In the backend folder

```env
DB_USERNAME - Database username
DB_PASSWORD - Database password
DB_NAME - Database name
DB_HOST - Database host
DB_PORT - Database port
TEST_DB_USERNAME - Test database username
TEST_DB_PASSWORD - Test database password
TEST_DB_NAME - Test database name
TEST_DB_HOST - Test database host
TEST_DB_PORT - Test database port
```

4. Email service configuration
   For the email service to run correctly, the user should add their own email credentials

```env
EMAIL_ENABLE - Enable email service (boolean)
EMAIL_HOST - Email host
EMAIL_PORT - Email port
EMAIL - Email
APP_PASSWORD - Email password
FRONTEND_URL - Url of the frontend server
```

Example configuration:

```env
EMAIL_ENABLE=true
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL=your-email@example.com
APP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
FRONTEND_URL=https://www.frontendserver.com
```

Note: When using Gmail, you'll need to enable 2-factor authentication and generate an App Password.

5. JWT Secret Key

```env
JWT_SECRET - secret key to sign the JWT token
```

- Use a strong, random secret key (minimum 32 characters)

6. Enable IP check for the API
   If the ENABLE_IP_CHECK is set to true, but the ALLOWED_IP_RANGE and ALLOWED_IPS are not set, the API will work for all IP addresses.

```env
ENABLE_IP_CHECK - Enable IP check for the API (boolean)
ALLOWED_IP_RANGE - Allowed IP range for the API with the format "baseIp/rangeStart-rangeEnd" (e.g. 192.168.1/1-255) separated by comma
ALLOWED_IPS - Allowed IP addresses for the API separated by comma
```

Example configuration:

```env
ENABLE_IP_CHECK=true
ALLOWED_IP_RANGE=192.168.1/1-255,10.0.0/1-100
ALLOWED_IPS=203.0.113.1,203.0.113.2
```

Note: For security reasons, it's recommended to always set either ALLOWED_IP_RANGE or ALLOWED_IPS when ENABLE_IP_CHECK is true.

7. In .env.test file, the user should have the following environment variables, so the postgres container can run correctly:

```env
POSTGRES_USER - Test database username (The same as TEST_DB_USERNAME)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD - Test database password (The same as TEST_DB_PASSWORD)
POSTGRES_DB - Test database name (The same as TEST_DB_NAME)
```

For running tests in windows installing `win-node-env` module is recommended

## Showing guides on the screen

After setting up the project, copy and paste the script that can be found in the Code tab of the Settings. Modify Api Base URL to point out to the url of tour backend server. The code snippet can also be found here:

`
window.bwApiBaseUrl = 'https://guidefox-demo.bluewavelabs.ca/api/';
                window.bwAgentBaseUrl = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bluewave-labs/bluewave-onboarding@agent-1.0.0/jsAgent/';

                var s=document.createElement("script");
                s.type="text/javascript";
                s.async=false;
                s.onerror=()=>{console.log("onboard not loaded");};
                s.src = window.bwAgentBaseUrl + '/main.js';
                (document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0] || document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(s);
`

We are working on a browser extention to move this code there to improve the user experience.
